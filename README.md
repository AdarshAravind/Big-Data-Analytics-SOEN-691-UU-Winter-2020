### *ABSTRACT*

*As a team, we chose to do a dataset analysis on “Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Dataset from UCI repository” dataset using two classification algorithms (Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM) using scikit-learn libraries. The dataset has captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz, containing 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables and labels namely six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone on the waist performed by a person. The goal of this project is to train the model, interpret and discuss the results of the data analysis with various metrics such as accuracy rate, F1 score, precision and recall.*
